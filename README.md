# lean_ui_kit

We are building a small ui_kit for us and we are happy to share with you.
We hope is will be usefull. :) 

## widgets:
- LeanButton
- LeanContainer
- LeanContainerScrollable
- LeanText
- LeanHeading
- LeanScaffold
- LeanSpacedColumn
- LeanSpacedRow
- LeanIcon
- LeanTextField
- LeanProgressBar
- LeanContainerScrollableSearchable (i like that one)

## screens:
- LeanScreen
- LeanListScreen

## theming:
We wrote our own theming idea;
A little bit for practise, a little bit because i think some theming things are easier with it.
- Use AppThemeAccess.init({required AppTheme theme}) to enable theming.
- AppThemeAccess.theme to access current theme.
- We have predefined theme for free use. (LeanAppTheme)
- Darkmode is supported but optional.
